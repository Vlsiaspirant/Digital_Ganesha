# Digital_Ganesha
Using Verilog RTL and Testbench, I designed a ROM-based system that stores pixel data to display a beautiful image of Lord Ganesha. Every bit of data was carefully fed to bring the image to life on the output.Working on this project made me realize how engineering precision and devotion can beautifully coexist. 

HIGHLIGHTS:-

1) ROM-based pixel data storage & retrieval.
2) Accurate RTL design with Verilog.
3)A creative blend of digital design and devotion.

Here is the Output Attached below.
